### Basic Information

**Project Title:**
MakePlugin – AI-Powered WordPress Plugin Generator

**Short Description (under 255 characters):**
Turn your plugin ideas into WordPress plugins in minutes. Chat with our AI consultant, finalize requirements, and download your custom plugin ZIP—no coding needed. 

**Detailed Description (over 100 words):**

**Problem:** Extending WordPress websites - which power over 40% of the web - with custom plugins typically requires in-depth knowledge of PHP and WordPress architecture. This creates a barrier for website operators, designers, and content creators who have a clear idea of a needed function but lack programming skills. Hiring developers is costly, and existing plugins often fail to meet specific requirements. Even experienced WordPress users struggle to translate plugin ideas into working software efficiently.

**Our Solution:** MakePlugin functions like a software agency. It leverages a Generative-AI-driven multi-agent orchestration system to streamline plugin creation. Users interact with a WordPress Consultant Agent via chat to clarify requirements. Once finalized, a Developer Agent automatically generates the plugin, packages it as a downloadable, install-ready ZIP, and provides concise usage instructions. Users can iteratively request changes, enabling rapid, conversational development. It's literally like visiting a virtual software agency and having your plugin built for you.

**Target Audience:** WordPress site owners, bloggers, small business owners, and web developers who want to quickly create or prototype custom plugins without deep coding knowledge. Anyone looking to personalize their website without writing code can use it, and developers can leverage it for rapid prototyping.

**Unique Features:** 
- Democratizes plugin development through a fully conversational process requiring no prior technical knowledge.  
- Produces directly installable `.zip` files that adhere to WordPress standards, turning ideas into functional plugins in minutes.  
- AI-powered multi-agent system with context-aware orchestration between Consultant and Developer agents.  
- One-click download of functional WordPress plugins for seamless installation.  
- Iterative chat interface for clarifying requirements and requesting modifications.
