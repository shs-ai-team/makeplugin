Anyone can submit without logging in. Submissions are saved and displayed immediately below the form in a simple, readable list showing Name and Message, ordered with the newest first. Show clear success and error messages. Keep the layout minimal, responsive, and accessible, with subtle styling that fits most themes. Include a simple way to place the form-and-list on a page. No moderation, no pagination, and no extra fields or settings unless essential for this scope."
